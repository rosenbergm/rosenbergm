### Hey, I'm Martin 👋🏼

Everything I make in my free time (hobby projects,
school projects, etc) is uploaded here. 
Some technologies I use (sorted by most 
frequently used in the past months) are

- Rust,
- Python,
- TypeScript (mostly web frameworks like SvelteKit)
- Haskell,
- Elixir, and
- Elm.

I also dabble in embedded development (mostly
revolving around RISC-V). As part of my bachelor 
thesis, I am focusing on extending the 
[MSIM](https://github.com/d-iii-s/msim) emulator
to support RV-64 and writing a simple library
for easy use of a real board with a RISC-V core.
