### Hey, I'm Martin 👋🏼

A guy from Prague who likes coding and coincidentally currently works at *Google*.

Everything I make in my free time I put here. Some technologies I use are:

- TypeScript,
- Web frameworks like React (and recently SvelteKit),
- Elixir,
- Elm,
- and Rust.

Have questions? Send me an email at nitram.rosenberg@gmail.com. Check out my [webpage](https://marrrt.in) for some more stuff.

Cheers! 🚀
